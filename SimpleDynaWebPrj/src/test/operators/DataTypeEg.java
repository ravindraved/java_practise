 * Java Literals - Integer Literals 
 * 
 * Java Literals - Floating-point Literals
 *  * Floating-point literals in Java default to double precision. To specify a
 * float literal, you must append an F or f to the constant. You can also
 * explicitly specify a double literal by appending a D or d.

 * Which of the following primitive data types are not integer types? Select the
 * three correct answers.
 * 
 * a) boolean b) byte c) float d) short e) double

 * 
 * It is important to note that Java does not support unsigned types. All int
 * variants are signed. But char is an exception; it is unsigned and consumes 2
 * bytes in memory. It stores 16-bit Unicode UTF-16 character
 * 
 * Type Default Value byte 0 short 0 int 0 long 0 float 0.0f double 0.0d char
 * '\u0000' boolean false String or other object null

 * When a variable is declared local to a function it must be initialized or
 * assigned before its first use otherwise compiler reports an error
 * "variable <variable name> might not have been initialized". But when a
 * variable is declared as a class member or field, it is not always essential
 * to assign a value to the member. In that case class members are initialized
 * to some default values by the compiler
